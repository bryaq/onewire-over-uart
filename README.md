### Hardware

The original version mentioned in Maxim's application note is shown as below.

![Schematics](docs/pp2od_tt.png "Original version")

However you can use a simplified version:

![Schematics](docs/pp2od_rd.png "Simplified version")

If you are sure your UART host has open-drain outputs,
simply tie TX and RX together as mentioned by *vbranimir*.
Transistors can either be BJTs or MOSFETs.
The diode used in the simplified version should be fast and has a relatively low forwarding voltage.
1N4148 is known to work.

A USB to UART converter with TTL output is required,
unless you are using a SBC with native TTL UART **(NOT RS-232!)** such as Raspberry Pi.
Many USB to UART converters have TTL UART interfaces.
RS-232 UARTs should be avoided since its voltage is very high and can damage your device.
If you have to use one of such, insert a MAX232 or equivalent chip
between the RS-232 port and the circuits mentioned above.
It is usually easier and cheaper to just get a USB to UART converter with TTL output.

Here are a few tested converters, many of which are less than $5:

* SiLabs CP2102 USB to UART converters. Common and cost-effective.

* Prolific PL2303 USB to UART converters. Common and cost-effective.
    Some boards have problems with power output, especially 3.3V.
    Try powering your 1-wire device separately should problems arise.

* FTDI FT232L USB to UART converters.
    More expensive.

* Cypress CY7C65211 USB to UART/I2C/SPI converters.
    Less common on the market, this one is broken out from a Cypress MCU development board.

* WCH CH340G USB to UART converters.
    Common and cheap in China but might be slow.

* Microchip MCP2221(A) USB to UART/I2C converters.
    DIY-friendly.

### Software

Type `make` to get `lsow` and `digitemp_evil` compiled.
To build for Windows under Linux, try installing `mingw-w64` and then type `make OS=Windows_NT CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc-posix`.
Project files for MS Visual Studio Express are now included.

`lsow` is a tool that list devices on a onewire bus connected to a USB to UART converter.
Simply type something like `lsow /dev/ttyUSB0`
(or something like `lsow COM0:` under Windows) and it will show device IDs found on the bus.

`digitemp_evil` is a demonstration program that reads temperature values
from DS18S20/DS18B20/DS1822 onewire digital temperature sensors.
Type `digitemp_evil /dev/ttyUSB0` to read IDs and temperature values.
It will wait for conversion to complete, which usually takes around 0.75 seconds.
Additionally, Windows users can use `digitemp_monitor.bat` to monitor the temperature.
Linux users can simply use the `watch` command.

Alternatively you can use `digitemp_DS9097` in the `digitemp` package as mentioned by *vbranimir*.
